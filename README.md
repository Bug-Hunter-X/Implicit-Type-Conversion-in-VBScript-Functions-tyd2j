# Implicit Type Conversion Bug in VBScript

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit type conversion within functions.  VBScript's loose typing can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed. This example highlights a scenario where implicit type conversion within a function produces an unexpected result, particularly when dealing with comparison and numeric operations. The solution shows how explicit type casting resolves this.
